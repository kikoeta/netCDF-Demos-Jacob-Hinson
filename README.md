# Jacob Hinson's netCDF Demonstrations
A demonstration of all the things I have done in recent time with netCDF files, mostly from NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis Data.

This is intended to show the work that I have done with netCDF datafiles in an open manner.

## List of Projects:
**1) [Graphical temperature change across two dates](https://github.com/kikoeta/netCDF-Demos-Jacob-Hinson/blob/main/BF-Temp-Solver.ipynb)**
- This was done to emulate the blog post made by Planalytics (a business weather company) seen [here](https://www.planalytics.com/the-coldest-black-friday-weekend-in-10-years-had-consumers-gobbling-up-seasonal-categories/). I used the script to look at the change in surface temperature between years for the Thanksgiving/Black Friday weekend.
